3. If you see a tax amount, extract it (e.g., "$160.00" → 160.0)
   - Make sure it's the TAX amount, not the TOTAL amount
   - If you see "Tax (8%): $160.00 Total: $2,160.00", the tax amount is 160.00, NOT 2160.00

Question: Is the difference between extracted and calculated tax amounts:
1. An EXTRACTION ERROR (we picked the wrong number from document)?
   - Example: Extracted the "Total" amount instead of "Tax" amount
   - Example: Picked a number from wrong line
   
2. A REAL DOCUMENT DISCREPANCY (document has calculation error)?
   - Example: Document shows wrong tax calculation
   - Example: Document has typo
   
3. ACCEPTABLE ROUNDING (small difference due to rounding)?
   - Example: Difference < 1% of subtotal

Consider:
- If extracted amount equals the "Total" line value → extraction error
- If extracted amount is very close to calculated (±1%) → rounding
- If extracted amount is very different → likely extraction error (picked wrong number)
